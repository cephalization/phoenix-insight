# Project Tasks

Task tracker for multi-agent development.
Each agent picks the next pending task, implements it, and marks it complete.

## How to Use

1. Find the first task with `status: pending` where ALL dependencies have `status: complete`
2. Change that task's status to `in_progress`
3. Implement the task
4. Write and run tests
5. Change the task's status to `complete`
6. Append learnings to LEARNINGS.md
7. Commit with message: `feat: <task-id> - <description>`
8. EXIT

## Task Statuses

- `pending` - Not started
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `complete` - Done and committed
