# Project Learnings Log

This file is appended by each agent after completing a task.
Key insights, gotchas, and patterns discovered during implementation.

Use this knowledge to avoid repeating mistakes and build on what works.

## monorepo-init

- Converted the existing single-package root package.json into a workspace root by making it `private: true` and moving shared devDependencies
- The workspace scripts use `pnpm -r run <script>` to run scripts across all packages
- The pnpm-workspace.yaml file uses `packages/*` glob to match all packages in the packages directory
- The next task (move-cli-package) needs to recreate package.json inside packages/cli/ with all the CLI-specific dependencies that were removed from root (like @ai-sdk/anthropic, commander, etc.)
- Updated .gitignore to use `packages/*/dist/` pattern for ignoring build outputs in all packages
- The root package name changed to `phoenix-insight-monorepo` (private) - the CLI package should retain the original name `@cephalization/phoenix-insight`

## move-cli-package

- Used `git mv` to move `src/`, `test/`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.esm.json`, `README.md`, `.changeset/`, and `vitest.config.ts` to `packages/cli/`
- Also moved `CHANGELOG.md` (generated by changesets) to `packages/cli/`
- Removed the old `dist/` directory at root level (leftover from before monorepo structure)
- Created a new `packages/cli/package.json` by restoring the CLI-specific dependencies from git history (`git show f75f13f^:package.json`)
- The CLI package.json excludes shared devDependencies (rimraf, typescript, vitest, tsx, @types/node) that are now at root level
- No import paths needed to be changed because all internal imports use relative paths
- All 384 tests pass, build succeeds - the move was transparent to the codebase
- Next tasks will need to create `packages/ui/` for the UI package
