# Project Learnings Log

This file is appended by each agent after completing a task.
Key insights, gotchas, and patterns discovered during implementation.

Use this knowledge to avoid repeating mistakes and build on what works.

## monorepo-init

- Converted the existing single-package root package.json into a workspace root by making it `private: true` and moving shared devDependencies
- The workspace scripts use `pnpm -r run <script>` to run scripts across all packages
- The pnpm-workspace.yaml file uses `packages/*` glob to match all packages in the packages directory
- The next task (move-cli-package) needs to recreate package.json inside packages/cli/ with all the CLI-specific dependencies that were removed from root (like @ai-sdk/anthropic, commander, etc.)
- Updated .gitignore to use `packages/*/dist/` pattern for ignoring build outputs in all packages
- The root package name changed to `phoenix-insight-monorepo` (private) - the CLI package should retain the original name `@cephalization/phoenix-insight`

## move-cli-package

- Used `git mv` to move `src/`, `test/`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.esm.json`, `README.md`, `.changeset/`, and `vitest.config.ts` to `packages/cli/`
- Also moved `CHANGELOG.md` (generated by changesets) to `packages/cli/`
- Removed the old `dist/` directory at root level (leftover from before monorepo structure)
- Created a new `packages/cli/package.json` by restoring the CLI-specific dependencies from git history (`git show f75f13f^:package.json`)
- The CLI package.json excludes shared devDependencies (rimraf, typescript, vitest, tsx, @types/node) that are now at root level
- No import paths needed to be changed because all internal imports use relative paths
- All 384 tests pass, build succeeds - the move was transparent to the codebase
- Next tasks will need to create `packages/ui/` for the UI package

## scaffold-ui-package

- Used `pnpm create vite packages/ui --template react-ts` to scaffold the base Vite React TypeScript app
- Updated package.json with name `@cephalization/phoenix-insight-ui`, added `"private": true`, and scripts for `clean`, `test`, `typecheck`
- Added `--passWithNoTests` to the test script since the scaffolded project has no test files initially - prevents CI failures
- Tailwind v4 uses the new `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin and `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS instead of the old `@tailwind` directives
- Configured path alias `@/*` pointing to `./src/*` in both `tsconfig.app.json` (TypeScript) and `vite.config.ts` (Vite bundler) for consistent module resolution
- Removed the default Vite demo code (App.css, counter logic) and replaced with a minimal Tailwind-styled App.tsx
- The scaffold creates `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json` (for src), and `tsconfig.node.json` (for config files) - path aliases go in tsconfig.app.json
- vite.config.ts needs `resolve.alias` for runtime resolution, while tsconfig.app.json `paths` handles TypeScript compilation
- There's a peer dependency warning for @types/node version but it doesn't affect functionality
- Next task (setup-shadcn-ui) should run `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init` from within packages/ui directory

## setup-shadcn-ui

- Shadcn/ui requires the path alias to be defined in the root `tsconfig.json` file, not just in `tsconfig.app.json` - it doesn't look at referenced configs
- Added `compilerOptions.baseUrl` and `compilerOptions.paths` to `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` to satisfy shadcn's validation
- Used non-interactive init with: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init --template vite --base-color neutral --yes --src-dir`
- `react-resizable-panels` v4.x has a breaking change: exports are now `Group`, `Panel`, `Separator` instead of `PanelGroup`, `Panel`, `PanelResizeHandle`
- The `direction` prop on ResizablePanelGroup was renamed to `orientation` in react-resizable-panels v4
- Had to manually fix `packages/ui/src/components/ui/resizable.tsx` to use the correct import names and prop names
- Installed 13 components: button, card, input, scroll-area, separator, resizable, tabs, dialog, dropdown-menu, alert, badge, skeleton, sonner
- Shadcn adds `tw-animate-css` package for animation utilities and uses Tailwind v4's `@theme inline` for CSS variables
- Created a demo App.tsx that showcases all installed components to verify they work correctly
- All components render and type-check correctly; build produces 399KB JS bundle

## ui-app-layout

- Replaced the component showcase App.tsx from setup-shadcn-ui with the actual app layout
- The layout uses `h-screen` with flexbox to fill full viewport height: header with `shrink-0` and main content with `flex-1`
- ResizablePanelGroup uses `orientation="horizontal"` (not `direction`) for side-by-side panels
- Each ResizablePanel has `defaultSize={50}` (percentage) and `minSize={30}` to prevent panels from being too small
- Added sub-headers to each panel ("Chat" and "Report") to help users understand the interface
- The main content area uses `overflow-hidden` to ensure resizable panels work correctly
- Left placeholder comments for where ChatPanel and ReportPanel components will be integrated
- The Toaster component is included at the app level for toast notifications throughout the app
- TypeScript check passes, build produces 288KB JS bundle (smaller than demo since unused imports removed)

## ui-chat-store

- Zustand v5 was installed (latest version) - uses the `create` function with standard patterns
- Store tests need to reset state in `beforeEach` using `useChatStore.setState()` to prevent test pollution
- Added `updateMessage` action not in original spec but needed for streaming responses (append content to existing assistant message)
- Added `deleteSession` action for session management (switching away from deleted session defaults to last remaining)
- Added `getCurrentSession` convenience method that uses `get()` to access current state
- ID generation uses `Date.now()` + random string for uniqueness without external dependencies
- Tests in UI package go in `src/store/*.test.ts` pattern (alongside source) per TASKS.md, unlike CLI which uses `test/` directory
- All 24 test cases cover: session CRUD, message add/update, session clearing, connection state flags, edge cases
- Zustand store is lightweight - no middleware needed for basic state management (persist middleware will be added later with IndexedDB)

## ui-report-store

- Defined `JSONRenderTree` as `Record<string, unknown>` placeholder - will be properly typed when `@json-render/core` is installed in the `setup-json-render` task
- The `setReport` action has dual behavior: creates new report for new sessions, updates existing report for same session (preserving id and createdAt)
- When updating an existing report without providing a title, the original title is preserved using nullish coalescing: `title: title ?? existingReport.title`
- Report store follows same patterns as chat store: `generateId()`, state reset in tests, `getCurrentReport` helper
- All 25 tests cover: creation, updates, session lookup, deletion with currentReportId handling, list operations, edge cases
- Report-session relationship is 1:1 (one report per session), enforced by `setReport` update logic
